# 📡 C++ TCP Network Scanner/Port Scanner (Qt GUI)

⚠️ **Status: Early Development**

This project is currently in its very early stage.  
At the moment, the repository only contains two empty source files and serves as a starting point for development.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

The goal of this project is to build a:

- GUI-based TCP network scanner
- Fully written in modern C++
- Using Qt for the graphical interface
- With a built-in console inside the GUI to track and manage the application

This project is developed purely for learning purposes and curiosity — no commercial or any harmfull use intended. <br>
This is purely out of **curiosity** and **fun at coding** and why not? <br>
Insiparion will come from wireShark but not planned to support **any** exploits!!!
